        body: `You have been coding your whole life. You like it; you are passionate about it and probably really good at it too. But then you start leading a team, which means that everything should change.

        Or shouldn’t?
        
        It’s an eternal question for every manager from an engineering background.
        
        The hardest thing is to understand that you are not an actual developer anymore. You are now in a role with different responsibilities, different daily schedules, and tasks that involve different mental processes. Trying to mix business with pleasure, or in our case — trying to combine developing with management — is like working two jobs.
        
        And working two jobs may often lead to early burning out and, frankly, not being any good in either of them.
        
        Most development tasks require high concentration and focus, which contradicts the very nature of the team leader’s work. Constant meetings, calls, messages — a manager is always on alert. It’s tough to consider all the algorithm’s edge cases when your phone is ringing all the time.
        
        And on the other side, it’s hard always to be prepared to answer your teammates’ or customers’ questions if all you can think about is the efficiency of that function you just wrote.
        
        Being a good manager means giving up habits that make you inefficient, even if that means giving up coding.
        
        Another thing is that spending a lot of time on development gives you little time to do your actual job as a manager. And your job is managing other people. Though you will probably make time for your primary duties — assigning tasks, making estimations, communicating with the customer — you will miss out on all the other “noncrucial” parts of your job. You can get so invested in a feature that you will miss some critical signs of your employees becoming demotivated to do their work, tired, or less happy.
        
        You may not even notice that your team is no longer a team.
        
        Every good leader needs to monitor their team members’ emotional state. And it’s hard to do that if you are too busy.
        
        And, as you are busy, you become less creative. Who will come up with a new fun team-building activity? Most certainly not you, since you are too deep in the code.
        
        But what if I do not want to give up coding?
        It may so happen that plain management isn’t your path. Being a Team Lead is all about people; being a Tech Lead is about code. If programming is critical for you and brings you more joy, you may be more suited for a Technical Leader role. So choose wisely.
        
        But as a Team Lead, you are still most welcome to join code reviews and help your teammates with challenging coding problems if you want to.
        
        Consult. Guide. Assist.
        
        That’s your motto now.
        
        And of course, it’s always a good idea to keep reading technical articles, stay up to date with news and trends, solve little programming challenges for yourself to keep your brain sharp.
        
        But no full-time development anymore. Promise?`,

        body: `With years of experience working in software houses. I’ve been dealing with a lot of clients' applications that are barely maintainable.

        So what’s wrong and how am I identify those apps as “barely maintainable”. If we are used to implementing coding principles into our application then most likely we can identify whether an application is bad or good from the codebase perspective.
        
        These are the coding principles I used to use for the majority of my application.
        
        Make It Work
        The first rule before implementing any principle is we need to make sure our application works first as fully functional apps. What’s the point to have a fully maintainable codebase if the application itself can’t be used by the users at all.
        
        Because in the end, the user doesn’t care whether the application is built on a top super server and developed using the best coding principles. The user just cares whether the application work or not to help their needs.
        
        After the application is working as it is, then we can start working on implementing any coding principles that suit our applications.
        
        You Aren’t Gonna Need It
        Oh silly me, back in the day I was a junior software engineer I used to keep unused code, components, comments, etc just because I thought I will gonna need it later.
        
        But the reality is, I never use that piece of code for weeks or even months.
        
        First of all, we need to exclude any unused code from our main codebase, and if you insist to keep it because “you will need it later”, then just you version control system properly.
        
        If we remove a code from our codebase, there will be history in the VCS and we can easily roll back or copy-paste the old code without keeping that code forever in our codebase.
        
        In the end, the bigger codebase the bigger effort needed to maintain.`,
